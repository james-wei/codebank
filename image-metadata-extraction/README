Secure Image Metadata Extraction Tool
======================================

We write a metadata-extraction tool for PNG and JPEG-Exif images while
taking care to make sure our tool is secure against malicious inputs. 

For valid PNG files, our program prints out one line per tEXt, zTXt, 
or tIME chunk.

For valid JPEG files, our program prints out one line per Exif tag for 
the following Exif tag types: DocumentName, ImageDescription, Make, Model, 
Software, DateTime, Artist, HostComputer, Copyright, RelatedSoundFile, 
DateTimeOriginal, DateTimeDigitized, MakerNote, UserComment, and 
ImageUniqueID.
