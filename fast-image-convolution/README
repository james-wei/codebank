Fast Image Convolution
=======================

We optimize a formula for doing 2D convolution on images. 

This project was developed, tested, and run on a Dell Precision T5500 
Workstation with two Intel Xeon E5620 microprocessors (codename Westmere). 
Each has 4 cores, for a total of 8 processors, and each core runs at a 
clock rate of 2.40 GHz.

All caches deal with block sizes of 64 bytes. Each core has an L1 instruction 
and L1 data cache, both 32 Kibibytes. A core also has a unified L2 cache 
(same cache for instructions and data) of 256 Kibibytes. The 4 cores on a 
microprocessor share an L3 cache of 12 Mibibytes. The L1, L2 caches are 
8-way associative, while L3 is 16-way associative.

We optimize for a variety of kernels using techniques including register 
blocking, SSE Instructions, loop unrolling, padding matrices, cache blocking,
and parallelization using OpenMP.
